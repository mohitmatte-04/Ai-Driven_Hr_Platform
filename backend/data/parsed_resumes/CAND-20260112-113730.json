    "detailed_feedback": "Pratik Chemate presents as a highly motivated and academically strong candidate with a solid foundation in full-stack development and data science. His academic background, including a B.Tech and Diploma in Computer Engineering with a good GPA, combined with relevant certifications from IBM and MKCL, highlights a strong commitment to learning. The projects listed, such as the AI Email Reply Generator and GitHub Profile Searcher, demonstrate practical application of skills in modern technologies like Spring Boot, React, and Gemini API, with commendable quantifiable achievements. He also shows leadership potential through his involvement in organizing coding competitions.\n\nHowever, a primary area for improvement is the limited professional work experience, with only one completed 1-month internship. While an upcoming internship with EY-GDS is noted, it has not yet been completed. The absence of direct links to project repositories or live demos is a significant drawback, as it prevents a deeper assessment of his technical capabilities and code quality. Additionally, including profiles from coding platforms would further strengthen his application by showcasing problem-solving skills. Addressing these areas will significantly enhance his profile for junior to entry-level Full Stack Developer roles."
