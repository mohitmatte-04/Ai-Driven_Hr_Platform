    "detailed_feedback": "Pratik Chemate presents as a highly motivated and technically adept student with a strong foundation in Full Stack development and data science. The resume is exceptionally well-structured and keyword-rich, ensuring high ATS compatibility. Pratik demonstrates a good breadth of modern technical skills, including Java, Spring Boot, React, MERN stack, and Python, which are applied effectively in various projects. Quantifiable achievements, such as improving response times by 30% and data retrieval efficiency by 40%, highlight an impact-driven approach. The academic background is solid, complemented by relevant certifications and an IEEE paper submission, indicating a commitment to continuous learning and academic rigor. Active involvement in college coding clubs further showcases leadership and community engagement.\n\nHowever, the primary area for development is the limited professional experience, totaling only four months of internships. A notable red flag is the inconsistency in the EY-GDS internship dates (Dec 2024 - Jan 2025) being listed as 'successfully completed' while the candidate is still pursuing a B.Tech degree until June 2026. This needs clarification. While GitHub activity is good, the overall star count is low, and there's no visible presence on competitive coding platforms. To enhance marketability, Pratik should prioritize securing more substantial internships, actively engaging in competitive programming, and refining the online portfolio to clearly present project details and impact."
