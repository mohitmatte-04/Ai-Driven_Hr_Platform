    "detailed_feedback": "Khangesh Matte presents as a strong candidate for a DevOps Engineer role, demonstrating a highly relevant and modern technical skill set. The resume effectively highlights expertise in cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure), CI/CD pipeline management, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible). Quantifiable achievements, such as reducing errors by 40% and accelerating deployments by 30%, provide concrete evidence of impact in previous roles. The career progression from Embedded Systems Engineer to DevOps Engineer is a significant strength, indicating adaptability and a proactive approach to skill development.\n\nAreas for improvement primarily revolve around external validation and addressing employment gaps. The absence of verifiable GitHub, LeetCode, or Stack Overflow profiles is a notable weakness for a technical role, as these platforms often serve as a portfolio for engineers. Additionally, there are two unexplained employment gaps that should be clarified. Completing the 'in progress' AWS certification and pursuing other industry-recognized certifications would further strengthen the candidate's profile. Overall, Khangesh is a promising candidate with a solid foundation and relevant experience, but could enhance their visibility and credibility through a stronger online technical presence."
