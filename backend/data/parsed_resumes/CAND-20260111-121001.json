    "detailed_feedback": "Mohit Matte presents as a highly promising junior DevOps Engineer with a strong technical foundation and a clear passion for the field. Despite having very limited professional experience (started September 2024), the resume highlights significant contributions and quantifiable achievements in areas critical to DevOps, including CI/CD pipeline automation, AWS infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, and serverless cost optimization. The candidate demonstrates excellent breadth and depth in modern technologies like AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and Python, which are highly relevant to current industry demands. Furthermore, a strong academic record and proactive engagement in competitive programming (490+ DS&A problems, LeetCode rating 1412) underscore a robust problem-solving ability and a commitment to continuous learning. The resume is well-structured and keyword-optimized, scoring highly on ATS compatibility.\n\nThe primary area for improvement is the limited professional experience, which is understandable given the recent start date. The absence of direct URLs for LinkedIn, GitHub, and LeetCode profiles is a notable red flag, as it prevents external verification of personal projects and community involvement, which are crucial for technical roles. Additionally, while the technical skills are strong, formal certifications could further validate expertise. Overall, Mohit is a strong candidate for junior DevOps roles, demonstrating significant potential and a solid skill set, but would benefit from enhancing their online professional presence and considering certifications to complement their practical experience."
